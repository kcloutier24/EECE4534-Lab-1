After accepting this assignment in github classroom, each step is converted into a [github issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues). Follow the issues in numerically increasing issue number (the first issue is typically on the bottom of the list). 

Please commit your code frequently or at e very logical break. Each commit should have a meaningful commit message and [cross reference](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/autolinked-references-and-urls#issues-and-pull-requests) the issue the commit belongs to.
